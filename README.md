This is a quiz project. One could propably deduce as much from the repository name. So this project will be a lot like one I previously made (it's simply called 'Quiz'). This one will be basically identical, but with some different functions and whatnot. Primarily I want this one to be more smooth, and not as cluttered with old and outdated stuff. And I won't have three separate user interfaces this time. The React app will do for now. I'll be using an SQL database that I'll communicate with using an ASP.NET web API and EF Core.

Who needs spare time anyway? I need more REST. So I'll start by preparing the database creation and migrations and such using EF Core.

Several hours later, I've now successfully set up the SQL database. It took me quite a while, with a lot of struggles along the way, but the database has now been created using only EF Core. No SQL queries needed! Seeing that SQL database set up was mighty fine, indeed. I'll continue work on it tomorrow.
